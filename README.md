passenger rail tunnel. To do this, SQL  statements are used to return pairs of airports
that are between 300 and 400 miles apart and that had at least 5,000 (five thousand) flights per
year on average in each direction between them. Arrange the rows to identify which one of
these pairs of airports has largest total number of seats on the planes that flew between them
