# Recommendation-of-US-airports-that-should-be-connected-with-a-high-speed-passenger-rail 
Recommends which pair of United States airports should be connected with a high-speed
passenger rail tunnel. To do this, SQL  statements are used to return pairs of airports
that are between 300 and 400 miles apart and that had at least 5,000 (five thousand) flights per
year on average in each direction between them. Arrange the rows to identify which one of
these pairs of airports has largest total number of seats on the planes that flew between them.  
The project was originally done on the Virtual Machine provided by the [Cloudera in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloudera-big-data-analysis-sql-queries?specialization=cloudera-big-data-analysis-sql) authority. **I used Apache Impala platform for the SQL query in the VMware Workstation**. The dataset was provided inside the workstation.
